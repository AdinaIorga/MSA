# MSA
Project for Mobile Systems and Applications

Hello, welcome to the MSA project wanna-be of team Chaos Pixies. 
We will list here what you need to know about the project and the modifications brought by us.

First things first, we are working with Unity and we will frist try to make the app compatible with Android, and if we have some more time, maybe even an iOS version will be released.
As a starter, we got to work on the AR (Augmented Reality) option of the game. You can find some of the tutorials that inspired us in the "AR guides.txt" document. Unity has some options when it comes to AR, so you kind of have to fill in the exact information in order for it to work.
